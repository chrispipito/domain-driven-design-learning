# Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software by Eric Evans

The "blue book" of Domain-Driven Design introduces a design approach for software development centered around core business domain and logic. Evans emphasizes the importance of collaboratively modeling the domain with domain experts, using a ubiquitous language to bridge the gap between technical and business experts. *Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software presents* a set of strategic and tactical design patterns to help people tackle complexity and create maintainable, expressive software systems that align closely with the underlying domain.
