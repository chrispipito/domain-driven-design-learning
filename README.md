# Domain-Driven Design Learning

Welcome to Domain-Driven Design Learning and Practice! This repository is dedicated to helping people learn and apply the principles and patterns of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) in their work. Whether you're new to DDD or looking to deepen your understanding, there are a collection of tutorials, sample products/projects, and resources to help guide you.

## What is Domain-Driven Design?

Domain-Driven Design is a software development approach that focuses on modeling complex business domains in software. It emphasizes collaboration between technical and domain experts, using a common language (Ubiquitous Language) to create a rich, expressive model that aligns with the core business concepts and rules.

DDD helps people to collaboratively understand the business problem space and to create software systems that are:

- Maintainable and adaptable to changing business needs
- Modular and loosely coupled
- Expressive and aligned with the business domain
- Testable and robust

## Repository Structure
This repository aims to provide a comprehensive learning and practice experience for those interested in Domain-Driven Design. 

Inside you will find:

- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides covering various DDD concepts and practices including EventStorming, Context Mapping, Ubiquitous Language, Bounded Contexts, Entities, Value Objects, Aggregates, Domain Events, Domain Services, Repositories, and more along with code examples and explanations.
- **Sample Products/Projects**: Hands-on products/projects that demonstrate the implementation of DDD in different domains and complexity levels. As well as complete sample applications demonstrating the implementation of DDD principles in different domains and technologies.
- **Resources**: A curated list of books, articles, videos, and online courses for further learning and exploration.
- **FAQ**: Frequently asked questions and pitfalls related to applying DDD in real-world scenarios.
- **Contribution Guidelines**: Instructions on how to contribute new tutorials, sample projects, or improvements to the existing content.
