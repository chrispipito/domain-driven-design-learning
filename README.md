# Domain-Driven Design Practice

Welcome to the Domain-Driven Design Practice repository! This resource is dedicated to helping developers learn and apply the principles and patterns of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) effectively.

## What is Domain-Driven Design?

Domain-Driven Design is a software development approach that focuses on aligning the implementation with the core business domain. It emphasizes collaboration between domain experts and software developers, using a ubiquitous language and a deep understanding of the problem space. DDD provides a set of patterns and best practices to build software systems that are more maintainable, scalable, and resilient to changing requirements.
